# punnet_square
The Punnett square is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after Reginald C. Punnett, who devised the approach in 1905. The diagram is used by biologists to determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype
This tool automatically generates the predicted genotypes.
no need for manual square process and no need for testing the program as its already tested extensively.
Easy to use, changeable values, less storage space, efficient and most importantly, contains error detection functionality.
# Example-
        rR = wrong genotype, shouldn't have small "r" before the capital "R".
         The program automatically identifies this error and prompts the user with the correct values according to the number of times the error has occured
